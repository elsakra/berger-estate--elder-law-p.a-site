Most disputes don't start as lawsuits—they start as misunderstandings, missed expectations, or a contract that wasn't built for reality.

Here are five signals it's time to get counsel involved:

1. **Deadlines are being threatened** (or already missed)
2. **Money is at stake** and the other side is escalating
3. **Documents are messy** (and you need a defensible story)
4. **Internal stakeholders disagree** on the goal
5. **You need leverage**—but don't want unnecessary litigation

Early legal strategy is often less about "going to court" and more about protecting optionality.
